For details about these methods, please refer to [our paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1623).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nPNopt shares a similar interface with [TFOCS](http://tfocs.stanford.edu/), a popular software package for solving convex optimization problems in composite form. PNopt is also compatible with the suite of function generators included with TFOCS. To call PNopt, use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[x, f, output] = PNopt(smoothF, nonsmoothF, x0, options);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe input arguments are \r\n* ```smoothF```: a smooth function\r\n* ```nonsmoothF```: a nonsmooth function\r\n* ```x0```: a starting point for the solver\r\n* ```options```: an options structure created using the PNoptimset function\r\n"}
